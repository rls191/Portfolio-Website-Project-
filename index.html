        <h3>This is my final portfolio website for Composing Digital Media! I genuinely really enjoyed this course and the amount of creativity it gave me. Being able to make projects that interest me instead of writing a million discussion board posts a week was refreshing. I was able to do research that was interesting and fun to me at times! </h3>

        <h3> My audio narrative project was a super fun one to make! I was able to make a podcast style narrative that focused around the term queer joy! I was excited to use my knowledge and experiences to express my version of queer joy. My roommate and best friend, Miss Thiqqi, was able to join me for a short interview. This was my favorite project of the semester! </h3>

        <h3>My video essay highlights addiction to social media platforms. I chose this topic because I struggle with over overuse of social media. I enjoyed being able to use my past knowledge of video editing to make this project a simple and enjoyable production process! </h3>

        <h3>The website portfolio was the most challenging project for me. I got overwhelmed fast with this material and struggled to keep up at times. The coding aspect was very tricky to work with since this is completely out of my comfort zone and unlike anything I have ever done before. I am satisfied with my final product. While it might not be as cute as I imagined, it has all the materials present! </h3>
